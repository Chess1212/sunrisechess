  <h1>The Queen</h1>

  <br>
  <p>The queen is one of the chess pieces. It can move in every direction. The queen like all other chess pieces can not move on a sq-</p>

  <p>uare occupied by a piece of its own color. The queen is the most powerful piece because it has such a vast range, so players val-</p>

  <p>ue it. Players do not normally trade their queen for other pieces. The queen starts on the first or eighth of the d file, on the </p>

  <p>square next to the king. Players get only one queen at the start of the game, but can get others if they get to the other side of</p>

  <p>the board, and I have covered that in the video about pawns.   </p>
