  <br>
  <p>The king is one of the chess pieces. It can move one square in one direction. The king like all other chess pieces can not move on</p>

  <p>to a square occupied by a piece of its own color. Although weak, the king is the most important pieces because if it is attacked </p>

  <p>and can not move anywhere without being attacked, then the king that can't move lost the game. The king starts on the first or e-</p>
  <p>ighth of the e file, on the square opposite of it's own color. If the king is attacked by a piece of the opposite color, then the</p>

  <p>king is in check. The king can't move into check. If the king is in check and the side can not move the king, block the check, or</p>

  <p>capture the checking piece, then the king is in checkmate, losing the game.</p>
