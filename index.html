  <p>Imagine a game where bishops capture knights, queens protect kings, and pawns advance to enemy lines while rooks try to stop them.</p>
  <p>Imagine a game with two opposing sides, one white and one black, trying to capture the monarch of the kingdom. Imagine a game that</p>
  <p>pleases your every minute with happiness and challenges. Imagine a game that requires skill, smarts, and thinking ahead. This game</p>
  <p>has no need to just be imagined. This game already exists, is easy to learn, and is played by millions around the world. This game</p>
  <p>is chess. </p>
